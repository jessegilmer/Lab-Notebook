Thesis Project - Control of the red nucleus by cerebellum and basal ganglia

Long term goal: 
	At least one paper
	A completed thesis

Short term goals:
	NRSA submission in August
	BG Anatomy experiments
	Data from CBN -> RN stim experiments.
	EMG Experiments.
	An optimized experiment workflow/pipeline.

Actualization:

NRSA Submission in August:
	Requirements:
		Reworked NRSA documents.
			>[See comments]

		Data from CBN -> RN
		[] Plan B: Show "Crow" data. Anatomy was inconclusive.
		[] Plan A: Get F, G, H, I recordings and anatomy.

		Anatomy for GPi -> RN or SNR -> RN.
	
		Behavoior for GABAzine -> RN.
	
	Timeline:
		May Week 1: Hfix Training F-I.
		May Week 2: Recording best 2 mice.
		May Week 3: Recording best 2 mice/GABAzine.
		May week 4: Recording last 2 mice/ init. Surgery Cohort J-M.
		June week 1: Recording last 2 mice/GABAzine/box train J-M/Silver.
		June week 2: Birthday Vacay/ Hfix training J-M.
		June week 3: Hfix training J-M/ Record Best 2.
		June week 4: Record Best 2
		July Week 1: Record Best 2 /GABAzine.
		July Week 2: Recording last 2 mice/ init. Surgery Cohort N-Q.
		July Week 3: Recording last 2 mice/GABAzine/box train N-Q.
		July Week 4: Analysis / Hfix N-Q.
		August Week 1: Writing/Submission/Analysis/hfix N-Q.
	
		Instead of N-Q or J-M, A-D of GPi? wait and see F-I results.
		Anatomy from B & E? Still alive, 2 recordings with DiO.
		Anatomy/Tracing interspersed? At least by June-2w to get 6w expression.
