Phase 1: Subjects are water deprived and allowed free access to water via reaching in the free-moving behavioral chambers, typically for 8 hours each day. 
Subjects stay in this phase until they reach 100 times within 1 hour, for a minimum of 3 days.

Phase 2: Subjects are acclimated to head-fixation by being placed in head-fix rig for 10 minutes, with additional 10 minute durations per successive day until 30 minute sessions are in effect.
subjects are given lick-access to water during acclimation.

Phase 3: Lick access is gradually removed by moving the lick syringe away anterior and dorsally, until drop is alligned with nose. 
When reaching to nose is achieved, bimnaually, the syringe is moves laterally towards goal reaching limb until unimanual reaching is used.

Phase 4: Subject's craniotomy is opened, and recording is performed by lowering a silicone probe array 3.5 mm to RNm. 20 stimulated reaches are recorded per "power" level.
